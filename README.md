## Description
    I wanted to create a channel that's entirely run by a bot. So I created a new channel and built 
    it's admin bot, Dolores Abernathy. The bot curates, manages and posts content from around the 
    internet onto the channel at random intervals.

## Origin Of Name 
    The name is taken from a show called WestWorld, that's about a futuristic Western-themed 
    amusement park where the visiting humans interact with automatons and robots. However, all hell 
    breaks loose when the robots begin malfunctioning. And at the forefront of that robot revolution 
    is Dolores Abernathy.
